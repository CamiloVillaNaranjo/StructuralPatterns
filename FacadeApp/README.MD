# FacadeApp

## About this code
 
Imagine that you have an application that deal with domotic environments in your house, so instead of turnning on each subsystem Lights, Air Conditioner, Wifi Routter, etc. You only use a one controller that turns on or off all subsystems at one time.

## Facade Pattern

Is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
* You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.

### Cons
* A facade can become **__a god object__** coupled to all classes of an app.
